<h2>Before We Begin—</h2>

Thank you all for allowing me the opportunity to show some example of my coding in this assessment. I was very pleased when I read the requirements, as they are all everyday things for me.

When I started this assessment, I began by just starting to patch together copy and pasted examples my previous code I have written, but then I thought better. What I really wanted to do was not only meet the requirements of the assessment, but learn something along the way and become a more well-rounded programmer. After one of the video conversations we had, I got the impression that new technology was part of your culture. So I went with something I have used only a few times in my career, but wanted the opportunuity to get to know it better—I decidede to write this assessment is .NET 5 Core and Blazor.

My reasoning behind this choice was simple enough
<ul>
	<li>The exchange of data between server and client is simple and excellent for dynamic lists</li>
	<li>I wanted to explore/compare Razor components in the project compared to something like user controls</li>
	<li>It gave me an excellent excuse to read-up on the different/default caching approaches used with Blazor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's Dive In</h2>
<strong>Top 10/Index Page</strong>

A simple display of the connection of both the APIs to the client side. The one API populates a list of the the top players, whiel the second is diplayed when you toggle the 'Info" option for each player. This user a component to populate each one. As for the favorite players, since having a user login wasn't park of the requirements, I thought it best to just save the user favorites into a persistant cookie, and the toggle on the upper right hand filters out the unchecked palyers. 

<strong>NoSQL Example Page</strong>
Another simple display of a connection to a NoSQL database. For this I used Azure CosmoDB. The reason I chose NoSQL over SQL is because the data stores is small, and Cosmo is transactional that say a typical SQL database. Also, I wanted to familize myself with the recent updates to Cosmo's version.

Nothing fancy, just a few fields to collect inputs and a table to display/delete results.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

There is plenty of stuff not here in the assessment. I could have gone on and on making it as fancy as you can imagine, but there's something to be also said about getting a project done to specifications in a timely manner. If you have anymore questions about my experience with SQL, Linq queries, data binding or whatever else you can think of, please reach out to me. 

Once again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to display a very small part of my coding with this assessment. I look forward to speaking with you shortly.

Thanks,<br/>
